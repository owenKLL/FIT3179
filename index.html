        <h1>Scope</h1>
        <p> This relationship between sustainability and wealth will be investigated from <br>
            a <span class="emphasis">continental</span> level, where the data can be broken into: <br><br>
            <span class="Africa">Africa</span>, <span class="Asia"> &nbsp;Asia</span>, <span class="Europe"> &nbsp;Europe</span>, <span class="NA"> &nbsp;North America</span>, <span class="Oceania">Oceania</span>, and <span class="SA">South America</span>. <br><br>
            There will also be a more  granular <span class="emphasis">country</span> level of analysis when exploring this topic. <br><br>
            Some of the key metrics being discussed will be <span class="emphasis">GDP</span>, <br>
            <span class="emphasis">GDP Growth</span>, <span class="emphasis">&nbsp;Total Energy Consumption</span>,<span class="emphasis">&nbsp;CO2 Emissions</span>, <br>
            <span class="emphasis">&nbsp;Low-Carbon Electricity</span>, <span class="emphasis">&nbsp;Renewable Energy</span>, and <span class="emphasis">&nbsp;Population Access to Electricity</span>. <br>     
        </p>
        <h1>Biggest CO2 Emitting Countries</h1>
        <p> Looking at the data from <span class="emphasis">2000</span> to <span class="emphasis">2019</span>, the trend <br>
            shows that <span class="Asia">Asian</span> countries tend to be some of the <br>
            biggest emitters of <span class="emphasis">CO2</span> in absolute terms, which  can be<br>
            expected because of their larger populations. <br><br>
            <span class="Europe">Europe</span> has been decreasing over this time period, with <span class="emphasis">Germany</span> <br> 
            reducing from <span class="emphasis">830k (kt)</span> to <span class="emphasis">660k (kt)</span> across the time period.
        </p><br>

        <h1>Wealth & Energy</h1>
        <p> Narrowing in on the <span class="Africa">African</span> continent depicts a strong <br>
            positive correlation between <span class="emphasis">GDP</span> and <span class="emphasis">Total Energy Consumption</span> per capita, <br>
            which can be seen by the 45 degree line formed on the scatterplot. <br><br>
            This is in contrast to <span class="SA">South America</span>, which forms a flat line <br>
            indicating a weak correlation present. <br><br>
            The general movement of the points indicates a general increase in <span class="emphasis">GDP</span> and <br>
            <span class="emphasis">Total Energy Consumption</span> per capita, while the increase in <br>
            pont size in the upper right quadrant suggests that increased <br> 
            <span class="emphasis">Renewable Energy (%)</span> is associated with an increase in <br>
            <span class="emphasis">GDP</span> and <span class="emphasis">Total Energy Consumption</span> per capita.  
        </p><br>
        <section id="vis1" class="visualization">
            <h2>GDP vs Total Energy Consumption (kWh/person) per Capita</h2><br>
            <div id="vis1-container"></div>
        </section><br>
        <h1>Low Carbon Electricity</h1>
        <p> This chart displays how the <span class="emphasis">Average Low-Carbon Electricity (%)</span> of each <br>
            continent per year compares to one another in a proportional sense. <br><br>

            <span class="Oceania">Oceania</span> has remained relatively the same over the time period, <br>
            but we can see that <span class="Europe">Europe</span> has increased by about <span class="emphasis">15%</span> <br>
            while <span class="SA">South America</span> has decreased by about <span class="emphasis">5%</span> to about <br>
            the same average of approximately <span class="emphasis">60% Electricity</span> from <br> 
            <span class="emphasis">Low-Carbon</span> sources.

        <h1>GDP Growth during Covid-19</h1>
        <p> So far there is reasonable evidence to suggest a relationship <br>
            between sustainability efforts and wealth particularly in recent years. <br><br>

            However, the Covid-19 pandemic looks to have had a large <br>
            impact globally which could affect many sustainability efforts. <br><br>

            Of note, <span class="emphasis">Guyana</span> in <span class="SA">South America</span> had a major increase <br>
            in <span class="emphasis">GDP</span> by <span class="emphasis">43.48%</span> in <span class="emphasis">2020</span>, so it would be <br>
            interesting to see how much of this gets invested in <br>
            sustainability in the future years, given a lot of their wealth <br> 
            is sourced from oil. 
        </p><br>

        <h1>Future Sustainability</h1>
        <p> Regarding future sustainability efforts, it appears that <span class="Africa">Africa</span> will represent <br>
            a great opportunity for future endeavours. <br><br>
            As this is an area of immense population growth, <br>
            with a lesser percentage of the population having <br> 
            <span class="emphasis">Access to Electricity</span>, how this continent tackles sustainability <br> 
            will have a lasting impact thus representing an area for global investment.
